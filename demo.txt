Cybersecurity, also known as computer security, digital security, or information technology (IT) security, is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks: 
Purpose
Cybersecurity protects devices, networks, and data from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption. 
Importance
Cybersecurity is critical because of the increasing reliance on technology in daily life. Cyberattacks can lead to identity theft, data breaches, financial losses, and more. 
Challenges
Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is challenging because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. 
Categories
Cybersecurity can be divided into a few common categories, including network security, application security, and information security.
